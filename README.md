#Make a Tree smaller

# Steps to use:
- Change nameOfTree to tree name, if tree is inside a directory use "nameOfDirectory/nameOfTree"
- Set cuts to the desired cuts
- Set out as the desired output filename
- Change the smaller tree name, note that things like directory will still not be preserved.
